    Existentialism
</h1>

<h2>
    Overview
</h2>

<h2>
    Kant
</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>morality: rational will, universalizable</li>
        <i>rational will is not universal across people</i>
        <!-- <li>categorical imperative (test)</li> -->
        <li>concept consistency, rather than outcomes (consequentialism) </li>
        <i>exclude too little</i>: extra layer -- rational will
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>
    Kierkegaard
</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Leap of faith</li>
        Leaps from Kant: Kant's morality framework won't work (rationality doesn't give guidance), there is something above rationality -- faith. <br>
        <i>but lands in nowhere</i> <br>
        <li>Faith</li>
        Abraham's story: Faith is not trusting higher rationality. It must be paradoxical, absurd. <br>
        <i>A lamb giving up its rights in exchange of peace. Very submissive.</i>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>
    Sartre
</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Meaning</li>
        There is no external given meaning. Meaning is defined by ourselves. All meanings are equal. <br>
        <i>Takes the leap, and lands in meanings.</i>
        <li>Dilemma</li>
        There is no right or wrong choice. But keep in mind your choice determines who you are.
        <li>Freedom of choice</li>
        History/culture are not excuses of not being able to change. <i>no mercy</i>
    </ul>
    
</p>

<h2>
    Heidegger
</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Throwness</li>
        We are thrown to our current situation. We don't have choice. But make sure we are doing things we truly want to do, rather than following the crowd. <i>merciful but still critical</i>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>
    Camus
</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Meaningless</li>
        Myth of Sisyphus: Life is meaningless, the only thing you can do is to revolt. There is nothing you can improve and no meaning you can possess, but you can decide to be happy in your heart. Meaningless + happy is better than meaningless + suffering. <br>
        <i>I would rather defend my meaning than lying down.</i>
    </ul>
</p>



<h2>
    Nietzsche
</h2>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Meanings: strong vs weak</li>
        <li><a href="Thus Spoke Zarathustra.html">Thus Spoke Zarathustra</a></li>
    </ul>
