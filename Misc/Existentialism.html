<h2>
    Overview
</h2>

<h2>
    Kant
</h2>
<p>
    What guides us?
    <ul>
        <li>Rationalize morality</li>
        Will is the only universal &rarr; Derive the morality framwork from it. <br>
        <!-- <i>critics: rational will is not universal across people</i> -->
        <li>Categorical imperative</li>
        Morality criterion is based on concept consistency, rather than outcomes (consequentialism). <br>
        Example: promise. If everyone breaks their promises (universalize the behavior), then promise doesn't mean its original meaning (check the consistency). <br>
        <br>
        <i>YZ critics: excludes too little. There are many things which don't violate the consistency check but are not morality in common sense. E.g., killing people. </i><br>
        Kant's Tinker: extra layer -- rational will. <br>
        <i>YZ: but this loops back to how people "will" based on their history/culture/preference, which is not universal. Kant defeated. </i>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>
    Kierkegaard
</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Leap of faith</li>
        Leaps from Kant: Kant's morality framework won't work (rationality doesn't give guidance), there is something above rationality -- faith. <br>
        <i>YZ: but lands in nowhere</i> <br>
        <li>Faith</li>
        Abraham's story: Faith is not trusting higher rationality. It must be paradoxical, absurd. <br>
        <i>YZ: A lamb giving up its rights in exchange of inner peace. Very submissive.</i>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>
    Sartre
</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Meaning</li>
        There is no external given meaning. Everyone defines their own meanings (not universal). All meanings are equal. <br>
        <i>YZ: Takes the leap, and lands in the meanings.</i>
        <li>Dilemma</li>
        There is no right or wrong choice. But keep in mind your choice determines who you are.
        <li>Freedom of choice</li>
        History/culture are not excuses of not being able to change. <br>
        <i>YZ: no mercy</i>
    </ul>
    
</p>

<h2>
    Heidegger
</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Throwness</li>
        We are thrown to our current situation. We don't have choice. But make sure we are doing things we truly want to do, rather than following the crowd. <br>
        <i>YZ: merciful but still critical and awakening</i>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>
    Camus
</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Meaningless</li>
        Myth of Sisyphus: Life is meaningless, the only thing you can do is to revolt. There is nothing you can improve and no meaning you can possess, but you can decide to be happy in your heart. Meaningless + happy is better than meaningless + suffering. <br>
        <i>YZ: I would rather defend my meaning than lying flat.</i>
    </ul>
</p>



<h2>
    Nietzsche

        <li>Meanings: strong vs weak</li>
